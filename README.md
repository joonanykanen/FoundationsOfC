#  Foundations Of C

This repository contains my practical assignment of our university's C programming course. The idea is to analyze the data of different electricity sources' usage on different periods of time. The implementation has been done using linked list and dynamic memory allocation.

## Compiling and running the program

After you have downloaded the files from HTTavoite use make to compile the program. Assuming a linux distribution of some kind is in use.

```bash
  make
  ./HTTavoite
```
